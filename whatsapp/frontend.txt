@Neha Singh e-commerce me kya kya functionalities hongi batao,
E commerce basically flipcart jaisa kuch kam krega like
Phle hum customer ko apne products dikhayenge with price like flipcart
Phir uske bad ik option rhega add to cart/ add to bag/ wishlist krne ka 
Iske bad buy now ka option aayega iske badd address ka ik page khulega jisme sare address k details honge jaha pr product deliver  hogi 
Iske bad payment mode khulegi COD/ paytm/card 
Iske bad order placed hoga ...
For example: jaise Hume kuch kharidna hai tho as a user mujhe kya kya show hoga, online payment support karegi website ya only cash on delivery
